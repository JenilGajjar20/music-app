## Project Setup

### For Vue.js

- The CLI **(@vue/cli)** is a globally installed npm package and provides the vue command in your terminal.

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

- To create a new Project

```
vue create music-app
```

### For Tailwind CSS

- Install **Tailwind CSS** and its peer dependencies and then run the **_init_** command to generate two files **tailwind.config.js** and **postcss.config.js**.

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

- Now add the path to the tailwind config file as shown below:

```
module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html",
            "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};

```

- Now create an **_index.css_** file in the src(source) folder and add the **@tailwind** directive to the file for each of the Tailwind's layers.

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

> Note: In this project I have created a css folder inside of the assets folder which is inside the src folder.

- The assets is where you would put your _images/stylesheets/videos_ etc. that you will import in the vue files.

- Now after following the above steps, one last step is to import the css file in the **main.js** file.

```
import "./assets/css/tailwind.css";
```

- Finally run the serverðŸ˜ƒ

```
npm run serve
```
